📊 Population Data Analysis & Visualization Project
🧠 Project Overview

This project analyzes and visualizes the population data of countries from 1995 to 2020.
It explores trends, cleans missing values, and creates meaningful visual insights using Python data analysis libraries.
📂 Dataset

    Source: Countries Population from 1995 to 2020.csv

    Includes columns such as Country, Population, Density, Urban Population %, Migrants, Fertility Rate, etc.

🛠️ Technologies Used
